# Window Hiding DLL

## Overview
This DLL is designed to hide all windows of a process from screen recording or streaming software when injected. It effectively makes the target process invisible to screen capture tools while keeping it running normally.

## Features
- Hides all windows of the target process from being captured.
- Works with most streaming and recording software.
- Lightweight and efficient.

## Usage
1. Inject the DLL into the target process using any DLL injector.
2. Once injected, all windows belonging to that process will be hidden from recordings.
3. To restore visibility, unload the DLL or restart the application.
